# analyse_ab_test

A udacity project to AB test conversion rate data for landing pages to determine whether to adopt the new page or continue to use the old one. 

## Components

* Probabilities
* A/B Testing
* Regression

## Results

We showed that there is not a significant difference in conversion rates for the old and new landing pages both globally and when limited to specific countries.

After performing multiple tests on this data, we failed to reject the null hypothesis and recommend that the company continue using the old landing page globally.
